ðŸ“š JavaScript Projects

This repository contains small, hands-on JavaScript examples designed for learning and experimentation. Each example focuses on a specific conceptâ€”ranging from basic syntax and DOM manipulation to more advanced features like ES6 modules, React (with Vite), and containerized workflows with Docker.

The goal is to provide self-contained, easy-to-understand snippets that you can run, modify, and build upon without needing to install Node.js locally (thanks to Docker). Think of it as a JavaScript playground where you can:

Explore core JavaScript features.

Practice with React + Vite scaffolding.

Learn how to structure projects inside Docker containers.

Use examples as references for your own projects.
